# Pixelate_2020_Technex_IIT-BHU-
Here we are providing the python and arduino code which we used in **Pixelate 20**, an image processsing event. It is organised under **Technex**, an annual Technical fest of **IIT(BHU)**.

#### Problem statement-
Complete problem statement is [here](https://github.com/ujjawalece/Pixelate_2020_Technex_IIT-BHU-/blob/master/PS%20Pixelate.pdf).
Basically we have to design a BOT which can detect different shape and colour and can find an optimal path described in [PS](https://github.com/ujjawalece/Pixelate_2020_Technex_IIT-BHU-/blob/master/PS%20Pixelate.pdf). And can carry boxex from one point to another by using that path.
